        <p> Hi! My name is Mikaela and this is my Portfolio! On this web page you will learn a little bit about my life, my interests, and most importantly my work.
            Lets start with my education! I have a Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer Science. Totally unrelated to my current position as an HRIS Administrator and totally different in regards to my current ambitions.
            What can I say? I love to learn about various topics and my interests are so diverse that it has provided me the opportunity to gain experience and exposure to what I really want do in the future.
            As far as the future, I share that with my husband, in which we have almost been married for a year as of July 3rd. We've been together for 6 years after being friends in high school and dating in college. 
            He is my best friend and totally supportive of everything I want to do in life such as continuing my education, traveling, and maybe letting me convince him of adding more puppies into our lives.
            We currently have one dog named Kobe. I let my husband believe that we named him after the basketball player, but I just simply adored the name. 
            He is now a 3 year old morkie (maltese/yorkie mix) that has the energy of the commercialized energetic bunny and a heart of gold. 
            He's so sweet, but he also has a very terror.. I mean terrier side of him that often gets him in trouble and missing out on additional treats. Don't let that fool you though, he is extremely spoiled.
            The things I enjoy most in life are spending time with my loved ones, dancing, reading, traveling, and learning new things.
            I absolutely love all things that are creative! Art, Music, Dance, Design, etc! There is so much inspiration in the world and being able to use that platform as a developer is so exciting!
