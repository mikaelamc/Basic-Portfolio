        <p> Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Mikaela and on this web page you will learn a little bit about my interests, and most importantly my work.
            Lets start with my education! I have a Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer Science. My current position as a HRIS Administrator has provided me with a platform to discover my current ambitions.
            What can I say? I love to learn about various topics and my interests are so diverse that it has provided me the opportunity to gain experience and exposure to what I really want do in the future.</p>
            
        <p> My aspirations and current interests are in both development and data science. Technology is everchanging and to be a part of the growth is an experience of a lifetime! I plan to work towards being a contributor of value in this field.</p>

        <p> If I'm not working on various implementations at The Salvation Army or studying coding, I am catching up on my other interests. The things I enjoy most in life are spending time with my loved ones, dancing, reading, traveling, and learning new things.
            I absolutely love all things that are both creative and logical! Art, Music, Dance, Design, etc! There is so much inspiration in the world and being able to use that platform as a developer is so exciting!</p>
